  <h3>Liquid Propulsion</h3>
  <p><strong>2023 - Present</strong></p>
  <p>
    currently developing a 1000N (225 lbf) IPA-nitrous engine because i thought "hey, what if i made my own rocket engine?" fired a subscale hybrid motor to get some hands-on experience with nitrous handling and ground support equipment. lots of CAD work in Onshape and simulation in OnScale, plus making detailed drawings for machining and assembly.

<div class="project">
  <h3>High-Power Rocketry</h3>
  <p><strong>2019 - Present</strong></p>
  <p>
    building high power rockets on a budget using some unconventional construction methods. flew the same rocket twice in 24 hours to prove rapid reusability is possible (take that, spacex :p). working towards designing custom avionics boards that mostly work. level 2 certified with the National Association of Rocketry.
