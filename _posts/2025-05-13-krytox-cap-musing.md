title: The humble Krytox cap: Musings on work ethic and ownership

*Below is an edited version of a blog post I wrote for work. Only proprietary and/or export controlled information has been omitted.*

In the [Big Blue building], down the way past mountains of crates, inside the CWA, and inside a storage cabinet lives a handful of tubes of Krytox 240AC. Now, Krytox is one of those materials you didn’t know you always needed until you first use it. We use it liberally here at [Certain Blue Aerospace Company] for everything from o-ring lubrication to preventing fitting galling. You can find more than a few tubes in just about any work center. However, a startling trend has struck the Krytox supply in my local CWA: not a single tube has its cap.

I can already hear you saying “What the fuck is this rando yapping about?” I get it, this seems like a stupid thing to not only be upset about but also write a blog post about. My issue lies in the fact that this shows a blatant disregard for 5S procedures, lack of work ethic, and a dangerous level of complacency.

First of all, let us go over why tubes of Krytox — or anything else for that matter — have caps. Caps serve two purposes: to keep the stuff in the tube inside and keep stuff out of the tube outside. Believe it or not, we work on hardware inside of CWAs for a hopefully very obvious reason: keeping components clean. Sure, we use Krytox like it’s aerospace-grade mayonnaise on an aluminium sandwich, but PFPE contamination is a genuine concern for many of the components we work on within the confines of the big bubble cube.

It isn’t uncommon for tubes of consumables to be covered in small amounts of Mystery Goo — often the material they’re holding. But what about the times the Mystery Goo isn’t what you think?

That smear on the outside of your Cor-Ban? It might be Krytox from a capless tube. It might also be DOW 730, Loctite, Molykote, or one of the many other word-salad chemicals all jumbled in a cabinet with varying levels of sealing and cleanliness. Without a cap — and without caring — you’ve got no way of knowing. You may not even think twice when you grab a particularly slimy container. In an environment where small amounts of residues can result in bond-compromising contamination or broken down seals that “whatever” mentality suddenly becomes a work work stoppage, a nonconformance, or worse: an anomaly report.

A missing cap is a symptom. It’s what happens when people treat their tools and workspaces like everybody else’s problem. In a high-stakes environment like aerospace, your discipline bleeds into everything: torques, inspections, even how you log your work. If you can’t take five seconds to replace a cap, wipe off a container, or swap your gloves, what else are you letting slide?

5S isn’t just a buzzword filled “lean thing” managers like to slap on laminated posters. It’s the foundation of creating a consistent, reliable workflow not mired in chaos. “Sort, Set, Shine” starts with small stuff: replace a cap, wipe a container, swap your gloves. “Standardize, Sustain” is about building a culture where that becomes second nature. If that can’t be done, what are we even doing here?

Just two weeks ago I removed four tubes from the CWA with no caps, cleaned up the pool of Krytox oil that was contaminating everything in the cabinet, and replaced them with fresh materiel. Tonight there was no oil puddle, but there were six capless Krytox tubes. I’ve taped a note on the bench top above the storage cabinet that reminds those using the supplies inside to remember 5S principles.

I’m not here to be a Krytox cop. In fact, I hate getting needlessly pissed off over problems that shouldn’t exist. But I am here to give a damn about the work we do. We should all take pride in the work we do every step of the way. We’re building hardware that’s going to space for fuck’s sake! If something as tiny as a cap can tell you if someone cared — or didn’t — then it’s not just a tube of grease anymore. It’s a marker of pride, ownership, and embracing Team Blue.
