# hey, i'm [your name]

welcome to my little corner of the internet. i build things, break things, 
and occasionally write about it.

## what i do

currently working on [cool project name](#). when i'm not coding, 
you'll find me reading about obscure programming languages or making coffee 
that's probably too strong.

- backend dev (rust, python, go)
- occasional frontend when necessary
- interested in distributed systems, weird databases
