description: currently developing a 1000N (225 lbf) IPA-nitrous engine because i thought "hey, what if i made my own rocket engine?" fired a subscale hybrid motor to get some hands-on experience with nitrous handling and ground support equipment. lots of CAD work in Onshape and simulation in OnScale, plus making detailed drawings for machining and assembly.
