# Biblically Inaccurate Angel

#### July 2022

Biblically Inaccurate Angel was a 3D printed Level 1 high-power capable rocket standing 1.4 meters tall that was designed and built in the 72 hours before Hot Nozzle Summer. It served to test 3D printed components and attain my Level 1 high-power rocketry certification from NAR. 

The project was completed in January 2023 after two successful flights on 9 July 2022.
